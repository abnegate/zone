//! Zone Notify - one notification, every channel.
//!
//! [`Fanout`] delivers a [`Notification`] to every registered [`Notifier`]
//! concurrently and returns a [`Report`] saying what each one did. A channel
//! that hangs, fails or panics costs one entry in that report and nothing
//! else, so a misconfigured webhook cannot stop an email going out.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! use zone_notify::{Discord, Fanout, Notification, Severity, Slack};
//!
//! let fanout = Fanout::new()
//!     .with(Slack::new("https://hooks.slack.com/services/T000/B000/xxxx")?)
//!     .with(Discord::new("https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1/xxxx")?);
//!
//! let report = fanout
//!     .deliver(
//!         &Notification::new("Build failed", "3 tests failed on main")
//!             .severity(Severity::Error)
//!             .link("https://zone.test/builds/1"),
//!     )
//!     .await;
//!
//! for failure in report.failures() {
//!     eprintln!("{} did not take it: {:?}", failure.name(), failure.error());
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Credentials
//!
//! A webhook URL is a bearer credential: anyone holding it can post to the
//! channel. [`Endpoint`] keeps one in a [`SecretValue`](zone_core::SecretValue)
//! and no error, `Debug` or log line in this crate reproduces it. That
//! includes errors from `reqwest`, whose own `Display` appends the request
//! URL and is stripped before it is ever rendered.
//!
//! # Content
//!
//! A notification's text passes through [`zone_core::tools::sanitize`] as it
//! is built, which strips terminal control sequences and redacts credentials.
//! Bodies carry tool output and user data, a chat channel's history is much
//! harder to scrub than a log file, and control sequences in a message can
//! forge output in a terminal-based reader.
//!
//! # Outbound requests
//!
//! A workspace-configured webhook URL points wherever its author said, which
//! makes delivery a server-side request forgery surface. Each backend accepts
//! only `https` URLs whose host matches its provider exactly, and redirects
//! are refused rather than followed.
