//! Screening a training set before the run starts.
//!
//! [`crate::dataset::inspect`] reads what the captioner said about a set; this
//! reads the pixels. Both answer the same question — can this set teach one
//! subject — from independent evidence, so a burst the captioner happened to
//! describe eight different ways is still caught here.
//!
//! Three things are worth acting on. Near-identical frames train the adapter to
//! reproduce one pose, and a perceptual hash finds them. A frame the camera
//! smeared teaches blur as part of the subject. An image well under the
//! training resolution is upscaled into softness.
//!
//! Unlike `inspect`, this acts: the caller trains on [`Verdict::keep`] and tells
//! the user what [`Verdict::drop`] cost them, the same way auto-crop and
//! auto-caption fix a set rather than filing a complaint about it. Two rules
//! bound that. Nothing that fails to decode is ever dropped, because screening
//! is the wrong place to fail a run. And the set never falls below [`FLOOR`]:
//! when it would, the most salvageable rejects come back, since returning four
//! images and a clean conscience is worse than returning eight and a warning.
