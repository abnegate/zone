//! Turns a submitted clip into a LoRA training set.
//!
//! A video is a worse photo set than it looks. Neighbouring frames repeat each
//! other, and whichever frame the clock lands on is as likely to be smeared by
//! motion as it is to be sharp. Sampling therefore runs above the rate the
//! caller asked for and then earns that rate back: the sharpest frame of each
//! moment wins its slot, and a frame that repeats a shot already kept is
//! dropped rather than counted twice.
//!
//! What survives is cropped on its subject and mirrored in alternation, so a
//! subject filmed from one side does not teach the adapter that it only ever
//! faces that way. Finding the subject is where a clip has an advantage over a
//! photo: motion says which of the things in frame is being filmed, and it
//! costs nothing here because the same frame differences already decide which
//! frames are worth keeping.
